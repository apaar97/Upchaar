**_A central portal for Patients, Doctors and Hospitals to facilitate and manage appointments to provide efficent healthcare._**

##### Problems in current system
- Difficulty in getting appointments in large tertiary care hospitals 
- No mechanism present to inform patient if the same provider is available or not in the hospital on the scheduled date. 
- Absence of process of rescheduling appointment with any other provider and for follow-ups the appointment scheduling system does not generate any reminders to the patients
- If patient discovers late about the follow-up visit he has to do the entire process of appointment scheduling again to get the appointments done. 
- Lack of interface to link the current appointment system with the duty roster of the doctors

##### Features of UPCHAAR portal
- Appointment management system with provision for follow-up and rescheduling, with provision for SMS and app notifications
- Reminder system wherein the patients and the doctors will be reminded of their appointments in advance so that the chances of appointment being missed are minimized.
- Automatic rescheduling in cases of missed or periodic appointments.
- Includes a provision for emergency requests wherein the user can bypass the system and avail services in critical situations.
- Builds more trust among patients about the hospital and would also encourage patients to get timely follow-up visits done to improve their health.
